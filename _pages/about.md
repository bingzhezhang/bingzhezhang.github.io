I am a Research Associate at the Universität Siegen, Chair of Structural Analysis, working in collaboration with [Prof. Okyay Altay](https://www.bau.uni-siegen.de/subdomains/baustatik/mitarbeiter/altay/index.html). My research focuses on developing advanced data-driven methods for real-time hybrid simulations. I’m passionate about Structural Dynamics and Deep Learning Inplementation, and I'm committed to advancing knowledge through rigorous research, collaboration, and teaching.

Before joining Universität Siegen, I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) under the supervision of Prof. Kehai Wang. My doctoral research focused on [leveraging deep learning techniques to assess the seismic performance of highway bridges](https://bingzhezhang.github.io/talks/). During that time, I was a visiting Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering at McMaster University, working with [Prof. Cancan Yang](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/civil/faculty/dr-cancan-yang/). Additionally, I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Civil Engineering from [China Agricultural University](http://en.cau.edu.cn/). For more details, please find my [CV]().

You can find a detailed overview of my [projects](https://bingzhezhang.github.io/teaching/) or check out my [publications](https://bingzhezhang.github.io/publications/).

Outside of research, I enjoy going to the gym, taking road trips, and spending time with my family. Interestingly, I often find that exercising sparks many exciting ideas.
