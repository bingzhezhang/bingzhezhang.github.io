I am a Research Associate at the Universität Siegen, Chair of Structural Analysis, working in collaboration with [Prof. Okyay Altay](https://www.bau.uni-siegen.de/subdomains/baustatik/mitarbeiter/altay/index.html). My research focuses on developing advanced data-driven methods for complex response analysis of structures and components using real-time hybrid simulations. I am interested in all technologies that are innovative and life-changing.

Before joining Universität Siegen, I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) under the supervision of Prof. Kehai Wang. My doctoral research focused on leveraging deep learning techniques to assess the seismic performance of highway bridges. During that time, I was a visiting Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering at McMaster University, working with [Prof. Cancan Yang](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/civil/faculty/dr-cancan-yang/). Additionally, I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Civil Engineering from [China Agricultural University](http://en.cau.edu.cn/).

I’m always excited to explore new ideas, collaborate with like-minded researchers, and leverage innovative engineering solutions to address real-world challenges.
