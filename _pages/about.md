I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Universität Siegen, working in collaboration with [Prof. Okyay Altay](https://www.bau.uni-siegen.de/subdomains/baustatik/mitarbeiter/altay/index.html). My research focuses on developing advanced data-driven methods for real-time hybrid simulations and parameter identification.

Before joining Universität Siegen, I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) under the supervision of Prof. Kehai Wang. My doctoral research focused on leveraging deep neural networks to assess the seismic performance of highway bridges. During that time, I was a visiting Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering at McMaster University, working with [Prof. Cancan Yang](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/civil/faculty/dr-cancan-yang/). Additionally, I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Civil Engineering from [China Agricultural University](http://en.cau.edu.cn/). For more details, please find my [CV](https://bingzhezhang.github.io/cv/).

## My research interests include:
* Structural dynamics: Performance-based earthquake engineering, Experimental and On-site test
* Deep learning and optimization: Deep neural networks, Computer vision, Uncertainty quantification, Interpretable machine learning 
* Resilience assessment under multi-hazard: Earthquakes, Aging, Frozen Soil  

You can find a detailed overview of my [projects](https://bingzhezhang.github.io/teaching/) or check out my [publications](https://bingzhezhang.github.io/publications/).

Outside of research, I enjoy going to the gym, taking road trips, and spending time with my family. Interestingly, I often find that exercising sparks many exciting ideas.
