I am a phd student studying in the [School of Transportation](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/15/65/c7958a71013/page.psp), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Dr. Kehai Wang. My research experience focuses on the areas of experimental study of seismic isolation systems, optimization of seismic performance on structures, and deterioration assessment of aged bridges. In addition, I have experience in using deep learning techniques to improve transportation infrastructure resilience under multi-hazard impact. I am interested in all technologies that are innovative and life-changing.

I was a visiting phd student at the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/civil/) in [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), under the supervision of [Dr. Cancan Yang](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/civil/faculty/dr-cancan-yang/). In addition, I received my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Civil Engineering from [China Agricultural University](http://en.cau.edu.cn/). 

My detailed Curriculum Vitae can be found [here](../assets/Bingzhe_Zhang.pdf).

I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for postdoctoral positions in infrastructural hazard resilience assessment related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.

#Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
